# snapTen
A Discord Bot built using discord.py

SnapTen is a Discord Bot that sets the maximum number of messages in a channel to ten. The idea, which originated from a friend, was to make a _gimmick_ channel where users' messages won't linger on. Sort of like Snapchat, he wanted the conversations to disappear as they ended. 

I wrote the bot in python using the DiscordPy library. Additional features of the bot include sending a message announcing that the channel has hit its 9th (effectively 10th) message and the adding of a reaction of a number denoting the order of each message as they are sent.
